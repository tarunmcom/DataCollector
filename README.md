# DataCollector
Use this to capture images and label them same time for deep learning training.

**IMPORTANT **I created this for my weekend project. There is no guarantee of the code or the application. Use at your own risk.****

I have done some basic testing on **Windows 10**
Required Python modules to compile the source code:- opencv-python, winsound, PyQt6
Download the Application exe for Windows 10:- https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pPHGHLRKbFvUun0RYSgK_UjRQwKUySt4/view?usp=sharing
Steps to run the exe:-
1. Download and unzip https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pPHGHLRKbFvUun0RYSgK_UjRQwKUySt4/view?usp=sharing
2. Put the camera id in CameraSource.config , if you dont know id try numbers like:- 0, 1 , 2 ...
3. Run the exe application

Known Issue:- If the captured image size is big, its not fully displayed in the window. I dont get the time to modify code:- you can resize the bigger images before displaying in the window.
